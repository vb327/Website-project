        <ol>
        <li>  The close involvement of its author, J. K. Rowling, in many aspects of production, including story consultation and casting.</li>
        <li>The fact that, with the exception of Albus Dumbledore, whose actor needed to be recast due to the death of the original, all major ongoing characters will have been played by the same actors for the entire series. A few supporting players have been recast over the years, however.</li>
            <li>The conclusion of the series marks the first time a book series of this length, involving an ongoing story arc, has been adapted for film in its entirety, and without profound changes being made to the original storyline.</li>
            <li>The book series and film series were released over a ten year period. The Philosopher's Stone was first published in the UK in 1997, with the final book The Deathly Hallows published in 2007. Likewise the first film was released in 2001 and the series concluded in 2011 with the eighth and final film. Each film in the series has been released to critical and financial success worldwide.</li>
